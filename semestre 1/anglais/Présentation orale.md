Last revolution of administration system (field which focus on administrating servers and infrastructures) is the creation of containers with Docker by a French startup in the US
|> today, every companies use containers
|> founders of this technology wanted to innovate in France, but they cannot
|> why? because no one wanted to finance them

Why the heart of IT innovation is in the USA?
|> computer science subject -> IT, innovation and evolution of computer science
|> economic question -> economic growth and economic rules
|> philosophic question -> morality of economic growth and of the innovation
## Facts
Innovation in CS are in the US
|> GAFAM are American companies
|> virtual reality, blockchain, artificial intelligence, social network = leading by the US

European Union is not leading the high-tech
|> EU is focused on the mid-tech (incorporating high-tech in old high-tech like cars or energies)

Research in EU is very good in high-tech
|> 30-40% of cited papers in patents are from European college
|> but they are not 30-40% of patents from EU
-> issue between research and entreprise
## Economic Growth, Economic Rules and Innovation
Startups = new company in new high technologies

Not enough venture capital in EU
|> venture capital is a long-term investment $\neq$ bank loan is a short-term/mid-term investment
|> venture capital gives the right to fail to startups
|> bank loan do not: startups must create money rapidly to repay it
|> more easy to develop new edge-breaking technologies with venture capital: it takes lot of times

Institutions are not investing in new startups
|> in the US, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) invests in many new startups -> gives the money to do the research & development for edge-breaking startups
|> European Innovation Council (EIC) looks like DARPA, but is very different:
- has much lower budget
- does not primary focus on research & development
- helps more during commercialization
- does not help startups, helps well implanted companies
|> research & development costs much more than the commercialization
|> well implanted companies will not increase the economic growth as a working startup can do

Protecting rules restrict innovation
|> EIC is not as independant as the DARPA: EIC is managed by the European Council, not by experts (majority of the experts in the EIC are business-men, not scientists or economists)
|> EU rules are indirectly limiting bank loan to startups since the subprime crisis in 2008 -> limits the investment in startups (because we do not have enough venture capital)
## Morality of USA's Kind of Innovation
Unregulated innovation leads to lot of moral issues
|> social media not really a good thing for humanity: promote hate, increase depression and polarize the population (but not only that)
|> self-driving cars are dangerous
|> AI has lot of moral issues: creating fake news, deep fakes, modifies deeply the society without any evaluations, definitely not ecologic

Economic growth face many moral issues
|> economic growth seems to be linked with consumerism: consumerism exists since the 1950s, but exists since the end of the 19th century (https://journals.openedition.org/chrhc/1809)
|> consumerism is a big ecological issue: consuming more and more resources is opposed to the ecology and it is problematic for all other moral issues
|> to have an economic growth, you must have inequalities, and inequalities can be considered immoral if we want to have a true democracy (Philoxime)

But the right to auto-determination requires the innovation
|> auto-determination is the power to decide what we want to become
|> someone must control their life to have this power
|> without innovation in a world where innovation is the rule, if a country do not innovate, they will have to use the innovations of other (if it want to defend itself), so they will be dependant to another country -> they will not have the power to control their life because they must use others life to modify their own
|> if a country do not have this power, the people in it do not have this (because they are dependant to the country)
-> in politics, country's auto-determination is usually called sovereignty
## Conclusion
EU is not good in startups due to its societal institution (https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2024/popular-information/)
|> not enough venture capital and not enough investment of the public states

But innovation has lot of moral issues
|> consumerism, danger, ecological

Without innovation, a country cannot be sovereign because they are dependant to others

=> currently, incompatibility between two moral rights: equality and self-sovereignty (or right to auto-determination)
